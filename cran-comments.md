Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Arya (9:30)
  dataset (8:72)

The first is a surname. The second appears to be an acceptable spelling
according to the Oxford English Dictionary.

## Reverse dependencies

I have run R CMD check on the 22 reverse dependencies. There were no errors.
There were some warnings and notes but these appear unrelated to changes in optRANN.
