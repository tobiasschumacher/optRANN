# !! IMPORTANT !!
THis is a fork of Gregory Jefferis's RANN package, in which I added a functionality to perform random tie breaks. Most of the codehas been adapted from RANN or the underlying C++ package ANN by Sunil Arya and David Mount.
Still in developent stage.

For information on RANN, check the package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RANN/index.html) or Mr Jefferis's github repo (https://github.com/jefferis/RANN).

For further details on the underlying ANN library, see http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN.
